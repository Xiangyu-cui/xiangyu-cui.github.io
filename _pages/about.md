Welcome! 

I am currently a student in the Communication Theory Laboratory (CTL) at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). I have done some research on large-scale antenna array analysis and orbital angular momentum (OAM) communication analysis. I am open to all kinds of opportunities including research and work. 

I am always excited about meeting interesting people and making new friends and I am always excited about adventures and exploration.
