Welcome! 

I am a student at New York University Abu Dhabi under the supervision of Qurrat-Ul-Ain Nadeem. I was a student in the Communication Theory Laboratory (CTL) at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) under the supervision of Prof. Mohamed-Slim Alouini. I have done some research on large-scale antenna array analysis and orbital angular momentum (OAM) communication analysis. I am open to all kinds of opportunities, including research and work. 

I am always excited about meeting interesting people and making new friends and I am always excited about adventures and exploration.
